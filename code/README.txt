milestone1:
Open your terimal and type octave command (if your PC have already installed octave) then type run hello.m. You should use cd to go to the folder wihch has hello.m file. Then you can get hello world and 
y =

   1   2
   3   4
on your terimal

milestone2:
before run make, you need install octave on your PC.
For milestone2, we have p2_if.m p2_while.m p2_for.m p2_switch.m p2_GuessingGame.m.

p2_if.m: this file have if else statment for octave/Matlab
p2_while.m: this file have while loop statment for octave/Matlab
p2_for.m: this file have for loop statment for octave/Matlab
p2_switch.m: this file have switch statment for octave/Matlab
p2_GuessingGame: this is a Guessing game for octave/Matlab. you need input a number (1-100) to guess a number.You total have 10 chance to guess this number. it has while loop and if else statment.
If you want to run one of those progrom individually, you can type "octave filename" on terimal. To run octave(.m) file you need install octave.

milestone3:
before run make, you need install octave on your PC.
For milestone3, we have p3_single.m, p3_double.m, p3_logical.m, p3_char.m,p3_cellArray.m, p3_structure.m, p3_studentsGrades.m, p3_rTimeError.m nad p3_cTimeError.m .
p3_single.m : it is show the single type for the matlab/octave.
p3_double.m: it is show the double type for the maltab/octave.
p3_logical.m: it is show the logical type for the matlab/octave.
p3_char.m: it is show the char type for the matlab/octave.
p3_cellArray.m : it is show the cell array type for the matlab/octave. (for run this progrom, you need go to the octave. Then type p3_cellArray to show the cell Array)
p3_structure.m: it is show the structure for the matlab/octace.(for run this progrom, you need go to octace. then type p3_structure to show the structure for the matlab/octave)
p3_studentsGrades.m : it is print out the students name, final score and final grade. it is read from the cell array in the code. And saving the data into structure. Then get all data from the structure.

p3_rTimeErro.m: it is show the run time error for the octave/matlab.(it is not in the make file. For run this progrom, you need go to octave. Then run progrom,which type p3_rTimeError in the octave workespace)
p3_cTimeError.m: it is how the compile time error for the octave/maltab. (t is not in the make file. For run this progrom, you need go to octave. Then run progrom, which type p3_cTimeError in the octave workespace.)



milestone 4:
beforerun make, you need install octave on your PC.
for milestone4, we have p4_BasicClass.m and p4_maim.m file
p4_BasicClass.m: it show the how class to create and some method inside the class.
p4_main.m: it is script file for the octave/matlab. it looks like main function for JAVA. it can easay to call other function and class. Fot this milestone. It is creat two p4_BasicClass. It has a group data. Then it will shou plot grapg on you computer
